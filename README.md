# Collatz1

I read about the Collatz Conjecture and decided to write a JS function to demonstrate it.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture

Consider the following operation on an arbitrary positive integer:

If the number is even, divide it by two.
If the number is odd, triple it and add one.

The Collatz conjecture is: This process will eventually reach the number 1, regardless of which positive integer is chosen initially.
